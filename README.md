# Computer vision system for football performance analysis

Deep learning is more and more used for football preformance analysis. In this tutorial we are building a computer vision system with YOLO, to track players on the pitch.

You can find the full tutorial on [La revue IA](https://larevueia.fr/deep-learning-pour-le-football-computer-vision-partie-i/). 

This is only the beginnig of this project, I will be updating it every week. Feel free to share any advice or suggestion.
